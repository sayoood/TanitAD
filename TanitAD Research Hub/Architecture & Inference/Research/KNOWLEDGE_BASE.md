- [2026-07-08] [repo] Bake-off harness (WP3, backlog #2): OFAT one-lever-per-run driver — every variant is
  the base config with EXACTLY one field flipped (verified by a recursive dataclass `lever_diff`; a lever
  that lies about its fields raises), scored through the D1–D3 gate runner so a BLOCKED gate yields NO
  claim; multi-seed mean±95% CI; measured-params column (FLOPs/latency deferred to backlog #5, never mixed —
  G-AI2). 8 config-native runnable levers + 4 `planned` levers (AdaLN, RoPE, K-step, tactical-MoE-on-σ) that
  carry gate+hypothesis+WP pointer and refuse to run until model code lands. 16 tests; end-to-end on real
  smoke `WorldModel` → D3 BLOCKED / D2 MIXED on untrained latents (doctrine fires). Decision-grade sweep
  awaits trained ckpt — impact: WP3 / D-004 / H4·H5·H1·H15 — `../Implementation/incoming/2026-07-08-bakeoff-harness/`
- [2026-07-08] [arXiv 2606.31232] Delta-JEPA: reconstruction-free action-conditioned WM with a Latent
  Difference Action Decoder — reconstructs the executed action from the LATENT DISPLACEMENT between
  consecutive observations (= our A4 residual + A5 inverse-dynamics, arrived at independently); improves
  planning over JEPA/repr-learning baselines on 4 continuous-control tasks. Secondary summaries: AdaLN
  action injection, 6-layer causal predictor (not in abstract — flagged) — impact: H4 / H5 (residual +
  change-weight levers) — https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.31232v1
- [2026-07-08] [lit] Action-conditioned latent-predictor conditioning triangulated across 3 sources
  (2512.24497 AdaLN>FiLM +RoPE best; Delta-JEPA; OmniDreams 2606.03159 RoPE+AdaLN) + K-step rollout Pareto
  ≈ K=4 (2nd data point to 2512.24497's 6-step real). All entered as `planned` bake-off levers; each is a
  D-018 Tactic → escalate before touching the trained config — impact: H1 / H2 / H5 — see bake-off note
- [2026-07-08] [arXiv 2606.09311] FF-JEPA: hierarchical latent planners decompose long-horizon planning to
  beat compounding error + flat-CEM cost — Phase-1 comparison target; reinforces hierarchy (H1) as the
  compounding-error answer over flat rollout — impact: H1 (Phase-1 watch) — https://arxiv.org/html/2606.09311v1
- [2026-07-14] [arXiv 2512.24497] JEPA-WM planning ablation: faithful unroll ≠ planning success —
  **decode/probe quality is necessary but NOT sufficient**. So D1–D3 are instrument gates; closed-loop
  D4–D6 arbitrate. Also: AdaLN action-cond wins (our FiLM confirmed), +RoPE best; multistep rollout loss
  = data-aug vs compounding error (2-step sim / 6-step real); ViT-L enc + depth-12 pred optimal for
  complex real dynamics (validates base250); DINO > V-JEPA encoders (H4 arm-B data point) — impact:
  D1–D3 / H1 / H4 / H5 — https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24497
- [2026-07-14] [Meta V-JEPA 2 AC] 300 M block-causal action-conditioned latent WM predicting next-frame
  representation — same family & envelope as our 261 M operative path (D-008 scale sanity) — impact:
  H1 — https://arxiv.org/html/2506.09985v1
- [2026-07-14] [LeWM] stable end-to-end action-conditioned JEPA, 2 loss terms, no EMA/stop-grad, no
  collapse — supports our LeJEPA/SIGReg-only anti-collapse (H3, D-003); field converging on
  regularize-don't-stopgrad — impact: H3 — https://medium.com/@adnanmasood/leworldmodel-and-the-case-for-stable-latent-world-models-0e4c33ca0f3c
- [2026-07-14] [DriveMoE CVPR2026 / GEMINUS] Vision-MoE routes camera VIEWS + skill Action-MoE, on a
  LEARNED scene router. Our differentiator (H15↔H2): route the tactical/sensor MoE on ImaginationField
  epistemic σ (gate a sensor/expert only where imagination uncertainty is low) — principled, not
  black-box — impact: H2 / H8 / WP4 — https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16278 · https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14456
- [2026-07-14] [SqueezeBits / ModelOpt] Native TensorRT ViT INT8 is a trap (MHA/RoPE block kernel
  fusion). Use OwLite (30 % latency, 0.7 % acc drop) / DFQ-ViT / ModelOpt PTQ instead. Batch-free
  LayerNorm (our I2 choice) enables TRT-LLM fused reduce-norm on the batch-1 streaming path → keep
  LayerNorm-only + static [6,256,256] input — impact: H5 / CNCE / deploy (ESTIMATE, no measured latency)

- [2026-07-14] [ReflectDrive-2] masked-discrete-diffusion trajectory planners allow revision but are
  heavier than our discrete tactical vocabulary + imagine-and-select (K batched passes, ms, no CEM/
  diffusion) → Phase-1 comparison target, not adoption — impact: H5 / WP4 — https://arxiv.org/html/2605.04647v1
- [2026-07-14] [repo/theory 2606.27014] `p0-spectral-sizing` tool (backlog #0, L2): fits the
  action-conditioned transition operator (z_t,a_t)→z_{t+1}, reports σ decay / entropy effective-rank
  (offline twin of live erank) / 99%-energy knee / trade-off-optimal k* / spectral tail, and an
  OVER-/UNDER-provisioning verdict vs the 2048 readout (D-008). Recovers a known rank-5-in-32 spectrum;
  real sizing awaits a TRAINED comma2k19 checkpoint (untrained latents degenerate, P8). 8 tests —
  impact: H3 / WP3 / D-008 — `../Implementation/incoming/2026-07-14-spectral-sizing-p0/`
- [2026-07-14] [repo] D1–D3 gate runner intake pkg: instrument-doctrine gating (BLOCKED vs FAIL),
  ADE/FDE, I3 episode split, D1 vs-global-pool & D3 probe_real/imag ablations, extra_metrics seam for
  Thursday's suite; 13 tests — impact: WP6 / D-004 —
  `../Implementation/incoming/2026-07-14-gate-runner-d1-d3/`
