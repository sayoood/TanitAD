- [2026-07-16] [arXiv 2605.00066] Cross-benchmark study (15 methods): ADE/FDE have **no reliable
  correlation** with closed-loop Driving Score; NAVSIM PDMS correlates positively but **non-monotonically**
  with Bench2Drive DS (ranking inversions); fully-paired subset only n=8 — impact: validation strategy /
  D1–D6 (closed-loop arbitrates) / justifies custom suite — https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.00066
- [2026-07-16] [arXiv 2506.04218] NAVSIM v2 pseudo-sim (3DGS-augmented) R²≈0.8 vs closed-loop (0.7 pure
  open-loop); PDM-Closed **EPDMS=51.3** navhard (Mar-2026 snapshot); criticized as non-reactive, short-
  horizon, PDMS over-weights progress/comfort/TTC (thin on safety-critical occlusion = our OKRI/LOPS niche)
  — impact: LEADERBOARD context / metric-gap — https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04218
- [2026-07-16] [Bench2Drive] Closed-loop CARLA: 220 short routes, **one safety-critical scenario each**, 44
  categories×23 weathers×12 towns; SOTA ctx TF++/VLAAD-MIL DS 86.97/SR 71.97, ADT 77.90/55.0 — impact:
  closed-loop competitor rows / weak-spot scenario template — https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive
- [2026-07-16] [multi-source] CARLA closed-loop **~5 DS run-to-run seed variance** for the same model →
  gate claims need mean±CI over ≥3 seeds, CIs must separate to claim "beats baseline" — impact: G-B /
  validation rigor
- [2026-07-16] [UNECE WP.29, June-2026] Global ADS GTR adopted: SMS + credible-testing/safety-case (incl.
  validated virtual toolchains) + ISMR + **DSSAD** (standard format / retrievable via electronic interface
  / tamper-evident) — impact: REGULATION_TRACE / H10–H12 — Ressources/ECE-TRANS-WP.29-2026-139e.pdf
- [2026-07-16] [Deep Think 14 / this run] Custom metric suite implemented (LAL/TMS/OKRI/CNCE/LOPS +
  trajectory seam), 22 tests on analytic ground truth; plugs into the D1–D3 gate runner's `extra_metrics`
  seam (verified live) — impact: WP6 / G0.6 — `../Implementation/incoming/2026-07-16-eval-metric-suite/`
- [2026-07-05] [kickoff] Initial research baseline for all hypotheses established; discipline agenda
  seeds defined — impact: all — see `../../INITIAL_RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS.md`
