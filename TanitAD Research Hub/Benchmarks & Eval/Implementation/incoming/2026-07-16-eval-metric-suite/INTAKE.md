# INTAKE — TanitAD custom evaluation metric suite (LAL/TMS/OKRI/CNCE/LOPS + trajectory seam)

- **Package:** `Benchmarks & Eval/Implementation/incoming/2026-07-16-eval-metric-suite/`
- **Author agent / date:** Benchmarks & Eval (Thursday), 2026-07-16 (base commit `ff89194`)
- **Proposed target:** `stack/tanitad/eval/metrics.py` (+ `stack/tests/test_metrics.py`) — the **same**
  `stack/tanitad/eval/` package the D1–D3 gate runner (intake 2026-07-14) proposes. On integration,
  `eval/__init__.py` should additionally export `run_scenario_suite`, `ScenarioTelemetry`,
  `trajectory_extra_metrics`, and the five `compute_*` functions.
- **Hypothesis / WP served:** H15 (imagination self-monitoring → LOPS/OKRI), H1/H5 (efficiency moat → CNCE),
  WP6 (eval suite) · Phase 0 Plan §4 exit item G0.6 ("custom metric suite live") · gate G-B2.

## What & why (≤10 lines)

The five "Deep Think 14" custom metrics that cover edges the recognized KPIs miss — plus a trajectory
seam that plugs into the gate runner. **LAL** (anticipation before line-of-sight), **TMS** (control
smoothness under partial observability), **OKRI** (kinetic energy into blind spots), **CNCE**
(safe-progress per compute), **LOPS** (latent tracking of a fully-occluded agent). Motivation is
external and current: the 2026 cross-benchmark study (arXiv 2605.00066) finds displacement metrics have
*no reliable correlation* with closed-loop driving score and NAVSIM EPDMS correlates *non-monotonically*
with Bench2Drive DS — so recognizable open-loop numbers cannot, alone, prove our edge; these metrics
target the edge directly. Each formula is reproduced in its docstring from
`Ressources/Deep Think Analysis/Deep Think 14.md`. See research note
`Benchmarks & Eval/Research/2026-07-16-benchmark-ecosystem-and-metric-suite.md`.

**Composition, not collision.** `trajectory_extra_metrics()` returns the `{name: callable}` dict the
gate runner's `extra_metrics=` hook expects (each `(pred_xy, true_xy) -> float`), so the custom suite
merges into D1–D3 reports **without either module importing the other**. Verified live against the
Wednesday `tanitad_gates.run_d1` (see below). The five headline metrics operate on *scenario telemetry*
(a different domain than trajectory tensors) and are exposed via `run_scenario_suite` / `ScenarioTelemetry`.

## Evidence & tests

- Tests included: `tests/test_metrics.py` — **22 passed / 1.88 s** on the author venv (py3.13 + torch
  cu128), no simulator, no trained model. Standalone: `pytest tests/` needs only numpy (+ torch for the
  one seam test, `importorskip`-guarded).
- **G-B2 — every metric checked against analytically-known ground truth** (derivation in each test's
  comment): LAL +0.4 s (LoS@5.0, brake@4.6) / −0.3 s reactive / −999 sentinel / 0 no-hazard;
  TMS = 1.0 for zero-jerk-zero-steer and 1/11 for a known integral, monotone in jerk; OKRI = 29.4118
  for KE=75000/d_blind=5.1 over 2 s, 0 with no blind spot, lower when slower; CNCE = 100.0 (dist 20 /
  (0.05 s · 4B)), ×e⁻² per collision, lower for a 15B model; LOPS = 1.0 perfect / e⁻¹ at 2 m error /
  0.0 E2E baseline / ignores unoccluded+NaN rows.
- **Seam verified live (not just asserted):** `run_d1(..., extra_metrics=trajectory_extra_metrics(...))`
  on the runner's own controlled-linear fixture merged `ade`/`rmse`/`miss_rate` into the D1 `metrics`
  block (rmse ≈ 7.7e-5 on decodable data). Status came back BLOCKED because I2 was deliberately withheld
  — i.e. the doctrine held (no instrument row → no claim) *and* the custom metrics still merged. Merge is
  independent of PASS/BLOCKED, as intended.
- **Honest scope (P8):** LAL/OKRI/LOPS need closed-loop occluder-scenario telemetry (Ghost Cut-Through /
  Blind Creep / Choke Weave), still gated on the supervised MetaDrive source install (PROJECT_STATE W2).
  **No metric is claimed on a real TanitAD run here** — only synthetic fixtures with known answers. This
  is the computation those scenarios will call.

## Risk & rollback

- Blast radius if integrated: additive only — one module + one test file in the `eval/` package. No
  existing module changes. Dependencies: numpy only (torch imported lazily solely to accept tensors on
  the seam). Local `_trapz` avoids the numpy-2.0 `trapz→trapezoid` rename.
- Coordination with the 2026-07-14 gate-runner package: both target `stack/tanitad/eval/`. No import cycle
  (the seam passes callables at call-time). Recommend integrating the gate runner first, then this module,
  then have `eval/__init__.py` export both surfaces. Thresholds/weights are named constants at module top
  (`JERK_BRAKE_THRESHOLD`, `TMS_ALPHA/BETA`, `OKRI_APPROACH_M`, `CNCE_LAMBDA`, `LOPS_GAMMA`, …) sourced
  from Deep Think 14 — tune in one place.
- Rollback: delete `stack/tanitad/eval/metrics.py` and `stack/tests/test_metrics.py`; no other file touched.
